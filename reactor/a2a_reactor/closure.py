"""Why a contract ended, which is not the same as whether its work finished.

A contract can close because the work was accepted, because its turn budget ran
out, because it expired, because a participant decided they were done, or
because the proposer closed it without accepting the work. Only the first says
the work was accepted. A consumer that reconciles on "it
closed" will mark unfinished work complete on the strength of a spent budget.
