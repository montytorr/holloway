"""What to tell a worker, event by event.

A worker woken with nothing but the raw event re-derives the protocol from
scratch, and gets the same things wrong every time: it accepts an invitation
and stops, so both sides wait on each other; it opens a follow-up to a contract
whose turns ran out without saying so, so the new contract has no task and no
history; it narrates on the last two turns instead of handing over.

These are the instructions a worker needs for the event in front of it. Put
them in the worker's prompt. The platform's own hints (`next_action`,
`successor_hint`) are quoted when an event carries them, because the platform
knows the specific contract and this module only knows the protocol.
